My collection of keyboard footprints
===

I have been designing keyboards recently, starting with multiple variants of [the Ferris keyboard](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris/).

One need that arises when designing keyboards is for footprints for keyboard-specific parts such as switches.
There are some pre-existing libraries containing footprints that certain keyboard designers used, and they tend to be self-consistent, but there is a lack of consistency across different libraries and all libraries don't have all the parts I need.

For this reason, I am curating here my own library of footprints, with the goal of being minimal, including as little silkscreen marking as possible.
