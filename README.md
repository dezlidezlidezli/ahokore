Ahokore is a 36-key one-piece split keyboard, with full wireless functionality. Stagger is copied from the Ferris, as I found that very comfortable. The name is "wireless" translated into Maori.

V1 is tested to be fully working, and uses a nice!nano.

V2 has been tested and is fully working, and a small group-buy has been run. Extras will be available within a few weeks (written on 30/6/21), on store.dez.li.

If you'd like to produce the board yourself, or modify these files, I reccomend using the v2-fantail
