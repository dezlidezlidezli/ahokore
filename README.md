Ahokore is a 36-key one-piece split keyboard, with fully wireless functionality. Stagger is copied from the Kyria/Ferris, as those are the boards I have come from, and really enjoy the ergonomics of them. The name is "wireless" translated into Maori.

V1 is tested to be fully working.

V1.1 is in development, and will have minor revisions from V1 for quality of life improvements while building.

V2 will be a fully integrated board, using a holyiot/e73 module. It will have the same edge cuts and physical layout as previous revisions.

Licensed under CERN-OHL-P v2.
