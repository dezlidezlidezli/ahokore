Ahokore is a 36-key one-piece split keyboard, with full wireless functionality. Stagger is copied from the Ferris, as I found that very comfortable. The name is "wireless" translated into Maori.

V1 is tested to be fully working, and uses a nice!nano.

V2 protypes have been ordered, and will be soon tested.
